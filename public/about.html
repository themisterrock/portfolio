<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my conrner of the Web. I'm Andy Rock, a passionate Web Developer dedicated to creating unique web sites
   for individuals and business alike. Whether it's design flair, or functionality, I thrive on exploring new ideas,
  solving problems, and sharing my journey with others.</p>

<p>I started Dos Gatos Web Development almost two years ago, as a way of putting my interest into practical use, 
  which has led to where I am today. Over the years of learing to code I have had the privilege of meeeting some of the 
industry's top developers, and these meeting have taught me a very valuable lesson in web development. Every day is a
school day.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of community and collaboration. If you'd like to connect, feel free to use my contact page 
  on this site. Thank you for visitng my page! I look forward to connecting with you and sharing more about Dos Gatos
  Web Development.
